# STARS 2024 Design Final Project

## CPU TEAM 5
* Ainsley Strothkamp
* Alex Tauriainen
* Berin Celik
* Medha Shinde
* Shrienidhi Gopalakrishnan
* Peer Mentor: Pranav Wadhwa

## Project Type
Our project was to create a 32-bit single-cycle RISC-V CPU.

## Pin Layout
Note that on the final chip, there are 38 gpio of which you have access to 4.
The first number represents the GPIO on the physical board. The second number
in brackets represents the number in your verilog code

### Inputs
* [33:0] keypad_in

### Outputs
* [00] lcd_rw
* [01] lcd_rs
* [02] lcd_en
* [10:3] lcd_data
* [14:11] keypad_out


## Supporting Equipment
4x4 keypad, 16x2 GDM1602K LCD screen

## RTL Diagrams
All the stuff from the proposal goes here, obviously updated from the time you did the proposal to the final layout
Include more than just block diagrams, including sub-block diagrams, state-transition diagrams, flowcharts, and timing diagrams.  If you include an image, a short (0.5-1 sentence description) is required.
You may also place other files within this folder.
