## Project Type
    Game Team 2, our bomb defusal game is a multiplayer collaborative game. One player works as the defusal squad team while the other is the bomb expert relaying info about how to defuse the bomb to the defusal team. The design of the game has four puzzles, menu states, a simple synthesizer, and four optimized seven segment displays. We got to learn key concepts making this design and hope you can enjoy playing it when you flash our game!

## Pin Layout
Note that on the final chip, there are 38 gpio of which you have access to 4.
The first number represents the GPIO on the physical board. The second number
in brackets represents the number in your verilog code
